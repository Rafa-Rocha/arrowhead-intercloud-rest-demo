# Arrowhead Framework Demo for REST-based Intercloud Communication

This repository serves as a demo for trying out the Arrowhead intercloud communication, using only HTTP/REST.
This demo replicates the following scenario:
1. Two Arrowhead Clouds (Cloud 1 and Cloud 2) are setup on different machines;
2. An Arrowhead Service Provider is registered on Cloud 2;
3. An Arrowhead Service Consumer asks Cloud 1's Orchestrator for the Provider's service on Cloud 1;
4. Cloud 1 checks that it does not have the requested service in its Service Registry and contacts its neighbor clouds to check if they have it, through the Gatekeeper system;
5. Cloud 1 realizes that Cloud 2 has the desired service and requests Cloud 2 for the Service Provider's address.
6. Cloud 2 sends the Service Provider's address to Cloud 1, and Cloud 1 sends it back to the Service Consumer.
7. Finally, the Service Consumer then requests the Service Provider for its service.

If this is your first time setting up an Arrowhead cloud, you should first check out Arrowhead's repository (https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java) for the tutorial on building and running the Arrowhead services.

For this demo, while you could technically run everything one one machine, it is recommended to use at least two machines, one for each cloud. Next, build the two clouds on each machine, import the corresponding SQL schema (located in _database-schemas_) for each cloud's database, and then run the two clouds.

Unfortunately, for the current version of Arrowhead you have to statically input each cloud's IP into the database. Thus, for both clouds' database, on the table "arrowhead_cloud":
 * Change the address "_192.168.60.22_" with your Cloud 1 address.
 * Change the address "_192.168.60.62_" with your Cloud 2 address.

Next, open the corresponding _default.conf_ file of the Consumer and Provider projects and change the IP of each Arrowhead service to its cloud's IP. Lastly, run the Provider first and the Consumer second.
